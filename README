PEG.js script to retrieve the table names, columns names and types from an input with a series of CREATE TABLE statements, according to the SQLite grammar.

Only what solves my specific problem has been put in the script. The CREATE TABLE grammar is not fully implemented (e.g. reserved words are all expected to be uppercase).

The SQLite grammar was taken from SQLJet: http://svn.sqljet.com/repos/sqljet/trunk/sqljet/src/main/antlr/org/tmatesoft/sqljet/core/internal/lang/Sql.g

The pegjs script has been built and tested only in the PEG.js online tool: http://pegjs.majda.cz/online
